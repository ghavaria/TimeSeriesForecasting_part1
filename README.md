# TimeSeriesForecasting_part1

##### Defining the time series

##### Analysing a time-series data to identify patterns.

##### Build various time series models to forecast

##### Evaluate the forecast using various error measures

- started this session by exploring the difference between time series and simple regression.
- Exploring the popular smoothing techniques used for forecasting and built them on Air Passenger Traffic Dataset to forecast the future.
- started this by first exploring the simple forecasting techniques. They are:
 --- Naive method
 --- Simple average method
- After that to evaluate the forecast you understood that we need to learn about the error measures and explore some of the popular error measures. They are:
 --- MFE, MAE, MAPE
 --- MSE and RMSE
- Then, using these measures you evaluated the forecast of Naive and Simple Average method.
- After that, you explored other simple and popular smoothing technique called Simple Moving Average, and also evaluated the forecast.
- Then, you explored some other advanced smoothing techniques and also evaluated their forecast on Air Passenger Traffic data. They are:
 --- Simple Exponential Smoothing 
 --- Holt's Exponential Smoothing
 --- Holt-Winters's Exponential Smoothing
